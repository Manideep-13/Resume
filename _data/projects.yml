- name: Personalized Machine Learning Model for Sleep Detection
  id: project1
  description: >
      This is a research project that has the goal of developing machine learning models and algorithms using advanced computational techniques to detect the driver drowsiness
      early and guide the driver to safety. As a part of this research project, I already studied millions of data points that are generated from large RGB video sequences and performed template
      matching to detect the drivers' facial region then I applied fast Fourier transform to extract feature vectors and construct a feature space that allows machine learning classifiers to be trained
      to detect three phases of drowsiness (mild, moderate, and severe), now I'm studying the artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks to develop enhanced modes.
