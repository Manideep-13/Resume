<h5 class = "mx-auto">“Education is the best friend. An educated person is respected everywhere. Education beats the beauty and the youth” - Chanakya</h5>
<p>
During my childhood, I grew up in an environment where my uncle got a lot of respect because he was well educated. He was one among the very few who had studied in one of the highly reputed colleges in our country. This inspired me a lot and from then I came to know how much education was important in one’s life. My parents taught me that education is the only wealth which cannot be stolen, and it is the one which builds up life. These words had a wonderful influence on my mind. Right from my childhood, I learnt the subject in a conceptual manner rather than by-hearting it. This helped me to learn and understand the subjects in the later classes with ease and score good grades.

Looking back over the years, my education at Narayana Junior College, Vijayawada provided me with the basics needed for education. Mathematics and Sciences strictly captivated me because they ruled everything around me. Participation in extra-curricular activities at pre-university like Quiz, games, cultural activities always asked for an innovative aspect in me. The childhood episode of accidentally dropping a remote-controlled car and watching my dad repair it, resulted in a radical transformation of my interests from the natural sciences to a deep-rooted passion for understanding and building the “brown boards and round structures” that I saw beneath the casing that day.
</p>
<p>
When I first stepped into college, I was equally drawn towards academics as those activities that helped develop my hands-on skills, creative expression, entrepreneurial outlook, and leadership orientation.
My personality makeup combined with insistence, inspired me to pursue an undergraduate course in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and further enhance my childhood passions. My strong appetite got me into R.V.R. & J.C. College Of Engineering, Andhra Pradesh. I have always been riveted by electronics, I am aware of signal processing theories and microcontrollers, what made me more stimulated in this area was when I heard about microprocessors, that's when I understood how to fuse the two fields with the theory. I was one among the students who are working with the SCILAB along with theory subject digital signal processing.

I was always amazed at the ability of computers and their use in the electronic industry while I was pursuing my Electronics and communication engineering degree. When I was exposed to subjects like Computer Programming, Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) and some of the electronic subjects with computer background like Embedded Systems, Microprocessors my interest towards the Computer Science stream increased. Now I clearly understood that to make any circuit or an electronic device to work efficiently or to increase the productivity of the machine, there is an urgent need for imparting the knowledge of computer into any field of studies like mechanical or electrical or electronics or any stream. There was a consistent rise in CGPA for each semester during my undergraduate course in the Department of Electronics, which is a matter of great pride for me. This shows my sheer determination to perform better and my passion to improve myself from time to time.

I worked through my first project on ‘Online Stationary Ordering System’ that helps optimize the billing counters in stationery stores that can further be modified to be used in other stores. I have also gained considerable training on various tools and applications through certificate programs, workshops and online courses, I have developed a major project on 'Detecting Phishing Using Associative Classification.’ that recognizes phishing e-banking web pages by utilizing data mining algorithms. This application can be employed by the growing e-commerce businesses of India to make the online transaction process secure.
</p>
<p>
I plan to always stay hungry for knowledge and remain foolish enough to wade deeper into the world of the unknown, where big discoveries are being made. My ultimate aim is to create innovative products that make a real-world impact. In this booming world of software & Computer Science, where each day sees a wave of new concepts and emerging trends, I want to stay on the advancement and reach the summit in the field of Computer Science, my proficiency in Object Oriented Systems, Data Structures, Python and my enthusiasm to learn more, has helped me to acquire a job at Infosys Limited as a Systems Engineer.
</p>
<p>
In my past employment with Infosys, I have gotten through many challenges but my thirst to do more is not satisfied yet. I want to develop a comprehensive software which increases the ease of use and unlock the potential of drones to be used in more sectors. In a densely populated country like India, whose primary economic sector is agriculture, drones can help to optimize the use of resources such as water, seeds and pesticides more efficiently to save time, money and produce high quality crops. Additionally, data visualization and drones together can be deployed in several key areas such as disaster relief, search and rescue, emergency management. When combined with GIS and spatial analysis, it can also help me develop improved drone-based analytics to study problems in urban infrastructure planning and in designing effective 3D maps that address the necessities but transform millions of lives.
